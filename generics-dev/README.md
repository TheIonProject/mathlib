# Generics dev

This is a temporary folder. All files inside will be moved to their rightful place for proper testing and final implementation.

## File destinations

### IonWarnings.hpp

This file is going to be fundamental for the entire Ion project; it will likely be moved to a folder accessed by evey module

### MathGenerics.hpp

This file establishes the basic rules for math types, so it will be moved to libmath/Header later on.

### ArithmeticGeneric.hpp

This file will serve as a replacement for libmath/Header/Aritmetic.h and libmath/Source/Arithmetic.cpp.
Its content will likely be moved to Arithmetic.h, which may be renamed to Arithmetic.hpp. Arithmetic.cpp
is going to be deleted as functions bodies are in the header.
